### September 15, 2023 (No. 1) 

- Took stock of work previously done throughout July and August; initial outline is finished and contains a decently sized literature review and introduction, so it's nice to have that out of the way. Additional references are locked and loaded.

- Data has already been identified so I should probably try to obtain it soon-ish. I might call up the RAND Corporation sometime next week to see if they can send a copy.

- Mood: Upbeat

### September 22, 2023 (No. 2)

- Called the RAND Corporation to inquire about obtaining a copy of the dataset but couldn't get through to the relevant personnel; will call again some other time.

- Outline is pretty much done by now; methodology section could use some revision/clarification but that's about it.

- Mood: Neutral

### October 2, 2023 (No. 3)

- Submitted initial proposal for assessment, looking forward to Professor Graves' feedback; probably time to take a break for now and think about the next move; should probably try to finalise data within the next week.

- Mood: Upbeat

### October 12, 2023 (No. 4)

- Some great developments; had a phone call with a program director at  RAND to chat about getting their strike dataset and he put me in touch with a senior research fellow at the Center for a New American Security (CNAS). She reached out and offered to advise me on writing my paper; already emailed back to set up a meeting sometime next week.

### October 15, 2023 (No. 5)

- Expect the unexpected; decided to start gathering airstrike data since RAND doesn't seem to have that dataset on file. Turns out that https://inherentresolve.mil is down right now so I can't access the press releases, what a joy.

- Spent a bit of time parsing the GTD data instead and managed to do some preliminary tidying. Ran into some problems though when performing further transformations. Aggregating by week or month resulted in different numbers of Iraqi districts with recorded attacks in each month; could make merging the airstrike data problematic. Will think about possible workarounds over the next few days.

- Mood: Temporarily defeatist

### October 16, 2023 (No. 6)

- Looked for alternate ways to access press releases and found them on https://www.centcom.mil/MEDIA/PRESS-RELEASES/; will use this to gather strike data until https://www.inherentresolve.mil is working again.

- Mood: Neutral

### October 18, 2023 (No. 7)

- Received a surprise email from another researcher at RAND. Turns out he was the data lead on [that project](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA388-1.html) and sent me the strike dataset I was looking for, plus a bonus excel sheet with data on aircraft platforms; also offered to answer any questions and chat about my paper. I sent an email to schedule a meeting; really looking forward to that.

- Mood: We are so back

### October 21, 2023 (No. 8)

- Spent some time exploring the RAND CJTF-OIR dataset and it looks fantastic; really comprehensive and has detailed data on strikes, locations, plus granular info on effects on target, very nice. Also did some tidying and managed to get it in the format I want, so data is pretty much all set. Glad that headache is finally over.

- Mood: Hyped

### October 23, 2023 (No. 9)

- Managed to confirm a meeting on October 27th with the researcher at RAND who sent the dataset; now I'll get to chat about my paper and get some tailored feedback on the topic from a leading think tank professional. Going to pat myself on the back for managing to pull this off.

- Mood: Smug
