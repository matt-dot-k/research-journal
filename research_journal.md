# Research Journal

### September 15, 2023 (No. 1) 

- Took stock of work previously done throughout July and August; initial outline is finished and contains a decently sized literature review and introduction, so it's nice to have that out of the way. Additional references are locked and loaded.

- Data has already been identified so I should probably try to obtain it soon-ish. I might call up the RAND Corporation sometime next week to see if they can send a copy.

- Mood: Upbeat

### September 22, 2023 (No. 2)

- Called the RAND Corporation to inquire about obtaining a copy of the dataset but couldn't get through to the relevant personnel; will call again some other time.

- Outline is pretty much done by now; methodology section could use some revision/clarification but that's about it.

- Mood: Neutral

### October 2, 2023 (No. 3)

- Submitted initial proposal for assessment, looking forward to Professor Graves' feedback; probably time to take a break for now and think about the next move; should probably try to finalise data within the next week.

- Mood: Upbeat

### October 12, 2023 (No. 4)

- Some great developments; had a phone call with a program director at RAND to chat about getting their strike dataset and he put me in touch with a senior research fellow at the Center for a New American Security (CNAS). She reached out and offered to advise me on writing my paper; already emailed back to set up a meeting sometime next week.

- Mood: Ecstatic

### October 15, 2023 (No. 5)

- Expect the unexpected; decided to start gathering airstrike data since RAND doesn't seem to have that dataset on file. Turns out that https://inherentresolve.mil is down right now so I can't access the press releases, what a joy.

- Spent a bit of time parsing the GTD data instead and managed to do some preliminary tidying. Ran into some problems though when performing further transformations. Aggregating by week or month resulted in different numbers of Iraqi districts with recorded attacks in each month; could make merging the airstrike data problematic. Will think about possible workarounds over the next few days.

- Mood: Temporarily defeatist

### October 16, 2023 (No. 6)

- Looked for alternate ways to access press releases and found them on https://www.centcom.mil/MEDIA/PRESS-RELEASES/; will use this to gather strike data until https://www.inherentresolve.mil is working again.

- Mood: Neutral

### October 18, 2023 (No. 7)

- Received a surprise email from another researcher at RAND. Turns out he was the data lead on [that project](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA388-1.html) and sent me the strike dataset I was looking for, plus a bonus excel sheet with data on aircraft platforms; also offered to answer any questions and chat about my paper. I sent an email to schedule a meeting; really looking forward to that.

- Mood: We are so back

### October 21, 2023 (No. 8)

- Spent some time exploring the RAND CJTF-OIR dataset and it looks fantastic; really comprehensive and has detailed data on strikes, locations, plus granular info on effects on target, very nice. Also did some tidying and managed to get it in the format I want, so data is pretty much all set. Glad that headache is finally over.

- Mood: Hyped

### October 23, 2023 (No. 9)

- Managed to confirm a meeting on October 27th with the researcher at RAND who sent the dataset; now I'll get to chat about my paper and get some tailored feedback on the topic from a leading think tank professional. Going to pat myself on the back for managing to pull this off.

- Mood: Smug

### October 27, 2023 (No. 10)

- Had that meeting with the RAND researcher today; spent over an hour discussing the dataset and research setup; also chatted about some of the finer contextual details of aerial warfare operations; pretty illuminating stuff.

- Also got some neat feedback; he suggested including few case studies at the city-level to assess the impact of striking strategic targets. Said it could be an interesting contrast to the wider analysis I have planned. That sounds really interesting, I'll definitely take a look at it.

- Mood: Upbeat

### November 1, 2023 (No. 11)

- Started assembling data for the event studies; still need to choose relevant targets and an appropriate time window.

- Mood: Neutral

### November 3, 2023 (No. 12)

- Thought about the event study setup a bit more; Maybe I could have side-by-side comparisons of strikes against the same target in two different
cities? That would be pretty neat. I'll give it a shot and see how it goes.

- Decided to use strikes against command and control (C2) and supply routes as the treatment for the event study.

- Mood: Neutral

### November 4, 2023 (No. 13)

- Assembled target data for Mosul and Ramadi and ran the event studies. Turns out that attack data in Ramadi is too sparse to consistently estimate
a model. I guess that's the end of that.

- Mood: Unimpressed

### November 5, 2023 (No. 14)

- Going to take a break for a while to focus on a paper for another class; will return in a week or so.

- Mood: Neutral

### November 15, 2023 (No. 14)

- We're back; planning on spending the next few days fine tuning the analysis to make it more tractable.

- Mood: Neutral

### November 18, 2023 (No. 15)

- Took a break for a few days to think about some possible final revisions to the analysis; Decided to focus ONLY on the
Battle of Mosul for the event studies due to its criticality in defeating ISIS.

- Also included event studies on communications infrastructure and IED facilities to cover all 4 target categories for a more
comprehensive analysis, should be interesting.

- Mood: Neutral

### November 19, 2023 (No. 16)

- Got the data for the two extra event studies and ran the models; looks pretty good, time to compile the results and make some
charts

- Mood: Upbeat

### November 22, 2023 (No. 17)

- The end is in sight; started making presentation slides since all the results are in. Should I add background pictures of fighter
jets to make the slides look cooler? I think I should.

- Mood: Upbeat

### November 26, 2023 (No. 18)

- You win some, you lose some; Slides are all done but I caught a wicked cold so I can't record the presentation otherwise
it'd sound like I have sandpaper stuffed down my throat. I guess that'll have to wait a few days.

- Mood: Annoyed

### November 29, 2023 (No. 19)

- Made a last minute tweak to the research setup. Swapped fatalities from ISIS terror attacks for ISIS insurgency actions to
better capture overall ISIS activity in response to airstrikes.

- Managed to update the data without any hassle and reran the analysis; results look promising.

- Mood: Upbeat

### December 2, 2023 (No. 20)

- Home stretch; Presentation's finally recorded and ready to go; hopefully whoever watches it finds it half as interesting as I do!
All that's left is to write the paper and we're finally done.

- Mood: Hyped

### December 7, 2023 (No. 21)

- Good progress on writing the paper so far; main results section looks good so far

- Mood: Neutral

### December 10, 2023 (No. 22)

- Paper's nearing completion; still need to finish the write-up for the case study and add some stuff to the literature review;
introduction section could also use some revision; Will also need to reformat 

- Mood: Neutral

### December 16, 2023 (No. 23)

- That's a wrap; Paper is officially finished and submitted for review! It's certainly been an interesting journey, and not without
some frustrations along the way, but it's definitely one I'll remember.

- Mood: Accomplished
